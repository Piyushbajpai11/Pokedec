# 🃏 Pokémon Card App

A fun and interactive web application that displays Pokémon cards based on user input. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this app fetches data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and lets you explore Pokémon by type, search by name, and save your favorites.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔢 Choose the number of Pokémon to display (up to 10)
- 🔥 Filter by Pokémon type (Fire, Water, Grass, Electric)
- 🃏 Flip cards to reveal Pokémon stats (height, weight, abilities, XP)
- ❤️ Favorite/unfavorite Pokémon with persistent local storage
- 🔍 Search for any Pokémon by name
